# Data-Transformator — Executive One-Page

Purpose
- Provide a concise summary of the Data-Transformator MVP: what it does, strategic value, deployment options, and high-level effort to move to production.

What it is
- A focused ISO20022 transformation capability that converts pacs.008 (customer credit transfer) into pacs.009 (financial institution credit transfer) messages.
- Implemented as a Java multi-module project: `mapper-core` (MapStruct-based mapping logic) and `service` (Spring Boot REST facade exposing POST `/transform-payment`).

Value proposition
- Reduces integration effort by standardizing message transformations between customer and interbank formats.
- Enables faster onboarding of partners and simpler reconciliation by producing canonical pacs.009 documents.
- Flexible: can be embedded into existing payment platforms or deployed as a standalone microservice for incremental adoption.

Deployment options (recommended)
- Library / JAR (Preferred for engineering teams)
  - Embed `mapper-core` as a dependency in host payment platforms or batch jobs.
  - Advantage: minimal runtime surface, direct integration, lower operational overhead.
- Service / Microservice (Preferred for pilots & operational demos)
  - Run `service` Spring Boot app behind API gateway; accepts pacs.008 XML and returns pacs.009 XML.
  - Advantage: easy to demo, runs in containers, suitable for staging and integration testing.
- Containerized / Managed Service
  - Package the `service` as a Docker container and deploy to k8s / cloud run for scalability and controlled rollout.

Production-readiness: estimated effort (T-shirt + 6–12 week breakdown)
- Baseline: MVP is functional for straightforward mappings (current state).
- Effort: Medium (4–8 engineer-weeks) to reach a safe, production-ready deliverable depending on scope.

Key workstreams and estimates
- Mapping completeness (2–4 weeks)
  - Expand MapStruct mappings to cover all required fields/variants; create canonical sample messages and contract tests.
- Testing & QA (1–2 weeks)
  - Unit tests, integration tests, contract tests with sample fixtures; run in CI and produce coverage reports.
- Security & API controls (1 week)
  - Add input validation, authentication, TLS configuration, and request size limits.
- Observability & Ops (1 week)
  - Add structured logging, metrics (Prometheus), and traces (OpenTelemetry) plus a basic health endpoint.
- Performance & Scalability (1–2 weeks)
  - Load testing, tune marshalling/unmarshalling, and define SLOs for latency/throughput.
- Packaging & deployment (1 week)
  - Add Dockerfile, CI pipeline artifacts, and deployment manifests (Helm/K8s or cloud-run).

Risks and mitigations
- Model incompatibilities: use conservative mapping and test fixtures; maintain a clear uplift plan for new message variants.
- Edge-case data loss: define mandatory fields and add validation + business rules before mapping.
- Operational readiness: ensure tracing/alerts and a rollback strategy for early deploys.

Recommended next steps (30–60 day plan)
1. Define target scope: list message fields and variants required by production flows.
2. Build canonical test corpus (sample pacs.008/pacs.009 pairs) and implement contract tests.
3. Harden `service`: add input validation, auth, logging, metrics, and a Dockerfile.
4. Run a pilot (sandbox) deployment behind an API gateway and run integration tests with a partner or internal system.

Contact / ownership
- Repository: `data-transformator` (root project)
- Suggested owners: payments platform team (mapping leads) + platform engineering (deployment/observability)
