# AI Docs Overview — Pain001 to CanonicalBizView (One‑Page)

Purpose
- Summarize all artifacts under mapper-core/ai_docs that enable AI-driven mapping from ISO 20022 (pain.001 focus) to canonicalBizView.
- Provide a fast index of what exists, how it fits together, and what’s ready to implement next.

What’s here (structure)
- Top-level
  - FINAL_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md — high-level index of achievements and readiness
  - conversation_history.md — full rationale, decisions, milestones
  - schema_analysis_results.md — cross-schema analysis (target + ISO sources)
  - pain001_to_canonical_schema_analysis.md — deep dive of pain.001 → canonicalBizView
- ai_prompts_and_context/ (4 files)
  - business_domain_glossary.md — payment terms, rules, and field intent
  - mapping_pattern_library.md — proven MapStruct patterns (direct, enum, date/time, amounts, parties, FI)
  - validation_rules.md — clean @BeforeMapping/@AfterMapping approach, quality gates
  - context_prompts.md — reusable prompt blocks for generation
- field_mapping_matrices/ (7 files)
  - 00_mapping_matrices_summary.md + 6 category matrices (direct, enums, datetime, amount/currency, party flattening, business logic)
- generation_prompts/ (8 files)
  - 00 index + 7 stepwise prompts (core mapper → direct → enums → datetime → amounts → party → business logic)

Methodology & architecture
- MapStruct-centric design: annotations for direct mappings; @Named helpers with qualifiedByName for complex transforms.
- Validation: fail-fast @BeforeMapping (Objects.requireNonNull) for mandatory source; @AfterMapping for business rules/target completeness.
- Separation of concerns: helper methods for choices/flattening; builder-style beans for complex nested targets.
- Integration: aligns with existing AbstractPaymentMessageMapper patterns; supports reuse across message types.

Mapping coverage snapshot (from matrices and prompts)
- Direct 1:1: 25+ fields (HIGH confidence)
- Enumeration translations: 15+ (MEDIUM)
- Date/time conversions: 10+ (MEDIUM)
- Amount & currency extraction: 20+ (MEDIUM)
- Party info flattening: 50+ (MEDIUM with helpers)
- Business logic derivations: 30+ (MEDIUM with helpers)
- Total: 150+ mapped fields organized by complexity and implementation strategy.

Validation & QA (from validation_rules.md)
- Mandatory checks: @BeforeMapping on MsgId, CreDtTm, PmtInfId, PmtMtd, Dbtr/Cdtr, Amt, etc.
- Target checks: @AfterMapping for payment_direction (pain001 → OUTBOUND), amounts, status, and completeness.
- Data quality: string lengths, formats (BIC, currency), address normalization; graceful handling for optional fields.
- Testing blueprint: unit (direct/transform/complex), integration (end-to-end), performance (batch/volume), edge cases.

Notable insights & decisions
- Complexity reduction: choice resolution + helper methods lift low-confidence mappings to medium and keep code clean.
- Status initialization: standardized INITIATION/INITIATED with subactivity based on payment method and context.
- Avro target: canonicalBizView root is Document (Podsbizview namespace); plan to generate POJOs via Gradle Avro plugin.
- Reusability: helper methods/beans are designed to be shared across other ISO message mappers (pacs.002/.004/.008/.009).

Ready-to-implement components
- Generation prompts: complete, phased from easy → complex with concrete patterns and validations.
- Mapper skeleton and helpers: fully specified in prompts/patterns (25+ helpers, 8+ supporting beans suggested).
- Matrices: field-by-field source→target intent drives annotation and helper generation.

Next steps (practical)
- Generate Pain001ToCanonicalBizViewMapper using generation_prompts (apply direct → transforms → helpers → validation).
- Configure Avro POJO generation for canonicalBizView and adopt generated types in mapper.
- Build tests per testing blueprint; smoke with minimal valid pain.001 and expand to edge scenarios.
- Extend the same approach to pacs.002/.004/.008/.009 with shared helpers and common base.

At-a-glance value
- End-to-end documentation (23 files) enabling consistent, production-grade, AI-assisted mapper generation with clear business alignment and validation baked in.
